    <h1>FLIPKART</h1>
    <p>
      Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore,
      and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially
      focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as
      consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.
    </p>

    <h3>2007–2010: Start-up phase</h3>
    <p>
      Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal,
      alumni of the IIT Delhi and former Amazon employees. The company was started from a
      two-bedroom apartment in Koramangala, Bengaluru. The initial investment was provided
      by their families, which was INR 2 Lakh from each family.
    </p>

    <h3>2011–2014: Growth, mergers and acquisitions</h3>
    <p>
      In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com and the
      digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak. Following the acquisition,
      Flipkart launched its DRM-free Digital music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition
      from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.
      Mime360 was a content distributor that used HTTP-based encryption technology that
      allows for fast and secure data delivery.
